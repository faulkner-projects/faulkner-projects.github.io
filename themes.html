    <h4>Loss of the Wilderness</h4>
    <p>As the story goes on, the wilderness seems to fade away. Old Ben, the most important figure of the forest, seems to be almost directly linked to the life of the forest. As he dies, so too does the real identity of the wilderness. He and Lion, foils of each other, meet the same end and thus mark the decadence of the wilderness, of the hunter’s aim to control the natural world. When the forest is ultimately sold to the lumber company, the wilderness is officially conquered, but at great cost. The land that had been there before any of them was to change forever in the name of human development.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Race Relations (Typically between White, African American, and Native American races)</h4>
    <p>This theme is mostly marked along Section 4. However, there is a distinction between race and social class. Sam Fathers was a former slave, but he is the son of a Native American chief. As such he holds a higher standing than Boon, someone who was white but of a lower class. It is interesting to note that the Chickasaw tribe holds a very high standing among the hunters, diverging from the stereotype that whites hold themselves to be superior to all other races. However, African Americans are still seen as very similar to slaves, especially in Ike’s shadow family. Although they are the residents of his family’s plantation house, he does not give them the full control of the plantation even after he chooses to refute his inheritance. This brings some irony into play; Ike wants to be a better person than Carothers McCaslin before him, but he will not go as far as to give African Americans the control of the plantation. Instead, McCaslin can still make money off it.</p>

    <h1>Prominent Characters as Symbols</h1>
    <h4>Old Ben</h4>
    <p>Symbolizes nature as a whole. He earned his name for his tenacity and his almost immortal appearance. He belongs to the forest, not to the people surrounding him. Only after being old does he fully comprehend the wilderness and the people attempting to control it. He gets respect not for being a bear, but for being one that was seemingly impossible to kill. Conquering him meant conquering the forest, ridding it of its very identity. Simple human guns were not enough to bring him down, which is why the hunters needed Lion. They needed to use nature to control nature, but they ultimately destroy it in their attempts to control it. They also lose the forest to the lumber company due to their quest to kill the bear.</p>

    <h4>Lion</h4>
    <p>He is interesting because he acts as an intermediary between the hunters and Old Ben. He comes from the wild, inevitably linking him with the latter. The hunters believe it is fate that they stumbled upon Lion, since he will be the tool that allows them to finally kill the bear. As such, he isn’t wild nor fully domesticated, but his metallic coloration makes him appear as a weapon in the hands of the hunters. His name echoes a powerful wild animal, but there is some irony in that it was given to him by humans. Thus, he is an intermediary between nature and the humans, never truly belonging to either. When Old Ben is finally brought down, it is not a coincidence that he takes Lion with him. Lion and Old Ben are essentially foils, two sides of a coin. As they are both from nature, when humanity seeks to control them, they are both inevitably killed. As they die, so does the wilderness, paving the way for the land to be sold away to the lumber company.</p>

    <h4>Ike</h4>
    <p>Ike, in the hunting segments of the story, acts as a symbol for humanity. He, like humans, is young, especially compared to Old Ben. He doesn’t gain a name until well into the story, implying that he was not an equal to Old Ben whatsoever. He has a fixation on being the one who kills the bear, believing it to be fate. However, when presented with a chance to do so, he freezes. He does not kill Old Ben because he does not think it is the time to; humanity should not control nature. He doesn’t see land as something that is owned, much like Sam Fathers. Instead, he views the wilderness as a semi-divine entity, one that should not be altered by anyone. He attempts to put fate into his own hands, to be the one that defies his perceived destiny, like he would later do with his inheritance. </p>
